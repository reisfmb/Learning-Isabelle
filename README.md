# Learning-Isabelle

The main goal of this repo. is to document my learning process in the assistant theorem prover Isabelle.

### CS | Concrete Semantics
That's the reference book. I'm trying to learn Isabelle by reading it (at least the first five chapters) and doing the suggested exercises of each chapter.
